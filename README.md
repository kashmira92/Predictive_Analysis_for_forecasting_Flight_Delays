Abstract

A lot of companies rely on different airlines for connecting them with other regions of the world nowadays because
the aviation industry is so important to the global transportation sector. However, problems like carrier delay,
air traffic control issue, connecting flight delay, security concerns and overbooking can have a direct impact on
airline services by causing delays in flights. In order to address this problem, precise forecasting of these aircraft
delays helps airlines to respond to likely causes of the delays in advance to lessen the negative effects and lets
passengers to be well prepared for the interruption caused to their journey. This projectâ€™s goal is to examine the
methods used to create models for forecasting aircraft delays.
